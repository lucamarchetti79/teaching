    "## Execution flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the lecture that there are at least three types of execution flows. Our statements can be simple and structured **sequentially**, when one instruction is executed right after the previous one, but some more complex flows involve **conditional** branching (when the portion of the code to be executed depends on the value of some condition), or **loops** when a portion of the code is executed multiple times until a certain condition becomes False.\n",

    "![i1](img/pract4/structured_programming.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "These portions of code are generally called **blocks** and Python, unlike most of the programming languages, **uses indentation (and some keywords like else, ':', 'next', etc.) to define blocks**.\n",

    "## Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use conditionals any time a decision needs to be made depending on the value of some condition. A block of code will be executed if the condition is evaluated to the boolean **True** and another one if the condition is evaluated to **False**. \n",

Note that the **condition is followed by a \":\"** character and that **the two branches are indented**. This is the way Python uses to identify the block of instructions that belong to the same branch. The **else keyword is followed by \":\"** and **is not indented** (i.e. it is at the same level of the *if* statement.
