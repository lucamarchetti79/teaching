    "The practicals of the first teaching module are a refinement of those prepared by Luca Bianco. Many thanks for his help.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this practical is to set up a working Python3.x development environment and will start familiarizing a bit with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "We will need to install several pieces of software to get a working programming environment suitable for this practical. In this section we will install everything that we are going to need in the next few weeks. \n",

    "Python3 is available for Windows, Linux and Mac, therefore you can run it on your preferred platform. \n",

    "\n",
    "If your computer has Windows installed but you want to learn Linux you have several options to get it to run Linux:\n",

    "1. You can install a virtualization software like [vmware player](https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_workstation_player/15_0|PLAYER-1550|product_downloads) and download the .iso image of a linux distribution like [ubuntu.](https://ubuntu.com/#download) and install/run it from vmware player. For more information you can look at [this tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rUhGWijf9U) Another option is to install [virtual box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).\n",
    "\n",

    "[Here](https://www.osboxes.org/virtualbox-images/) you can find some VDI images that you can load in virtual box or in vmware player with several different operating systems including Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Debian, Centos, Fedora, etc. Please refer to this [guide](https://www.osboxes.org/guide/) (for information on vmware please click on **VM IMAGES --> VMware IMAGES** in the menu of the page). \n",
