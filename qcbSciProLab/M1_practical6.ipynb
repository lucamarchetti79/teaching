    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a block of code that has a name and that performs a task. A function can be thought of as a box that gets an input and returns an output. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why should we use functions?** For a lot of reasons including: \n",
    "    \n",
    " 1. *Reduce code duplication*: put in functions parts of code that are needed several times in the whole program so that you don't need to repeat the same code over and over again;\n",
    "    \n",
    " 2. *Decompose a complex task*: make the code easier to write and understand by splitting the whole program into several easier functions;\n",
    "\n",
    "both things improve code readability and make your code easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic definition of a function is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def function_name(input) :\n",
    "    #code implementing the function\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    return return_value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are defined with the **def** keyword that proceeds the *function_name* and then a list of parameters is passed in the brackets. A colon **:** is used to end the line holding the definition of the function. The code implementing the function is specified by using indentation. A function **might** or **might not** return a value. In the first case a **return** statement is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following example in which we want to compute the sum of the square root of the values in lists X, Y, Z."

    "**Namespaces**  are the way Python makes sure that names in a program are unique and can be safely used without any conflicts. They are mappings from *names* to objects, or in other words places where names are associated to objects. Namespaces can be considered as the context and in Python are implemented as dictionaries that map the *name* to the *object*. According to Python's reference a **scope** is a *textual region of a Python program, where a namespace is directly accessible*, which means that Python will look into that *namespace* to find the object associated to a name. Four **namespaces** are made available by Python:\n",

If the name is not found there either, the Python interpreter will throw a **NameError** exception, meaning it cannot find the name. The order in which namespaces are considered is: Local, Enclosing, Global and Built-in (LEGB).  \n",

    "5. ```\"b\"``` binary mode. The file will not be a textual file.\n",
    "6. ```\"x\"``` exclusive creation. This will fail if the file already exists.\n",
    "5. ```\"+\"``` update mode. The file will be opened with read and write permissions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Opening modes can be combined (ex. ```\"ra\"``` would read and append, ```\"wb\"``` would write (and overwrite) a binary file, ```\"r+b\"``` read and write a binary file).\n",

    "1. Implement a function that takes in input a string representing a DNA sequence and computes its reverse-complement. Take care to reverse complement any character other than (A,T,C,G,a,t,c,g) to N. The function should preserve the case of each letter (i.e. A becomes T, but a becomes t). For simplicity all bases that do not represent nucleotides are converted to a capital N. **Hint: create a dictionary revDict with bases as keys and their complements as values**. Ex. revDict = {\"A\" : \"T\" , \"a\" : \"t\", ...}.\n",
