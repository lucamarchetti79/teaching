    "# Optional Module 1, Practical 12\n",

    "In this practical we will will see some other functionalities of Biopython. The content of this practical is **optional**!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Biopython\n",
    "\n",
    "From the Biopython tutorial: The Biopython Project is an international association of developers of freely available Python tools for computational molecular biology. The goal of Biopython is to make it as easy as possible to use Python for bioinformatics by creating high-quality, reusable modules and classes. Biopython features include parsers for various Bioinformatics file formats (BLAST, Clustalw, FASTA, Genbank,...), access to online services (NCBI, Expasy,...), interfaces to common and not-so-common programs (Clustalw, DSSP, MSMS...), a standard sequence class, various clustering modules, a KD tree data structure etc. and even some documentation :-).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical we will see some features of Biopython but refer to [biopython documentation](http://biopython.org/wiki/Documentation) to discover all its features, recipes etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "These notes are largely based on the tutorial that is available [here](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.pdf).\n",

    "## BLAST\n",
    "\n",
    "[Blast (Basic logical alignment search tool)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2231712) is a well known tool to find similarities between biological sequences. It compares DNA or protein sequences and calculates the statistical significance of the matches found.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical interaction with BLAST sees the user submit some sequences to the tool to get an alignment and then the hits are parsed to obtain information on the matches. Both these steps can be performed from within Biopython. Although it is possible to interact directly with a local installation of BLAST, in this practical we will work with the tool made available by NCBI (available [here](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi)). Note that this might require a lot more computational time due to the delays of the network and traffic limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The function qblast\n",
    "\n",
    "The online version of blast can be accessed through the ```Bio.Blast.NCBIWWW.qblast()``` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's basic syntax is the following (first import ```from Bio.Blast import NCBIWWW```):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "result_handle = Bio.Blast.NCBIWWW.qblast(blast_program, database, query_str)\n",
    "```\n",
    "where ```blast_program``` is the program to perform the alignment. The options are **blastn, blastp, blastx, tblast or tblastx**. ```database``` is the database to search against and ```query_str``` is a string containing the query to search against the database. The query can be a sequence or a fasta file entry or an identifier like a GI number (NCIBI's sequence identification number). Among the others, some optional parameters are the output format (```format_type``` that by default is \"XML\" which is the most stable output format but results can be stored also as text with \"Text\"). It is also possible to specify an expectation value cut-off to filter out alignments ```expect``` (the e-value threshold, default value is 10.0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some databases to search against are reported below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![dbs](img/pract11/blast_dbs.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The query string can be obtained in different ways, for example it is possible to load sequences from a fasta file with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from Bio.Blast import NCBIWWW\n",
    "fasta_string = open(\"myfile.fasta\").read()\n",
    "result_handle = NCBIWWW.qblast(\"blastn\", \"nt\", fasta_string)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or we can give a SeqRecord:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from Bio.Blast import NCBIWWW\n",
    "from Bio import SeqIO\n",
    "record = SeqIO.read(\"myfile.fasta\", format=\"fasta\")\n",
    "result_handle = NCBIWWW.qblast(\"blastn\", \"nt\", record.seq)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to specify some optional parameters in the ```entrez_query``` for example we can limit the search to specific organisms with: ```entrez_query='\"Malus Domestica\" [Organism]'```.\n"

If we expect to get one alignment only, we can use the method **read** otherwise (if we have multiple query sequences) we should use the method **parse**: \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving results to file\n",
    "\n",
    "To save the results present in the result_handle we can simply write them to file. In case we have only one entry we can read it and write it to file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "out_f = open(\"my_blast_result.xml\", \"w\")\n",
    "out_f.write(result_handle.read())\n",
    "out_f.close \n",
    "result_handle.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "If we have more than one entry we need to loop through all the entries and save them in the file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "out_f = open(\"my_blast_result.xml\", \"w\")\n",
    "for entry in result_handle.parse():\n",
    "    out_f.write(entry)\n",
    "out_f.close \n",
    "result_handle.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",

    "## Getting data from NCBI\n",
    "\n",
    "Biopython provides a module (```Bio.Entrez```) to pull data off resources like PubMed or GenBank, and other repositories programmatically through [Entrez](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are some limitations (mostly taken care of directly by Biopython) that you should be aware of when you use NCBI's services (e.g. they recommend not to run more than 3 requests per second on weekdays, ...). Check [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25497/#chapter2.Usage_Guidelines_and_Requiremen) if you want to learn what these limitations are.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all we need to import the Entrez module with (```from Bio import Entrez```) and then we can start interacting with Entrez, then we should specify (optional) an email setting ```Entrez.email``` (this is optional but you get a warning if you do not specify it -- the email would be used to notify the user in case of excessive usage).\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular the module (complete info on [Entrez module are here](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/api/Bio.Entrez-module.html)) provides, among the others, the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ```res_handle = Entrez.einfo(db)``` returns a summary of the Entez databases as a results handle. ```db``` is an optional parameter specifying the resource of interest;\n",
    "2. ```res_handle = Entrez.esearch(db, term,id)``` returns all the entries in ```db``` having query matching the term ```term```. It is also possible to specify an ```id``` to get the information relative to that resource id;\n",
    "3. ```res_handle = Entrez.efetch(db, id, rettype, retmode)``` returns full record corresponding to the identifier ``id`` from the database ``db`` formatted in ```rettype``` (eg. gb, fasta,... [complete list](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25499/table/chapter4.T._valid_values_of__retmode_and/?report=objectonly)) and return mode ```retmode``` (eg. text); \n",
    "4. ```res_handle = Entrez.esummary(db, id)``` returns the summary of the entry ```id``` from the database ```db``` as a handle;\n",
    "5. ```result = Entrez.read(res_handle)``` reads the information on the XML handle ```res_handle``` and stores them in a dictionary, list or string, depending on the case.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get a list of all available databases in Entrez as a dictionary. Let's then get a summary of the entries in 'sra'."
