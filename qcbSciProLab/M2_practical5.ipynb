    ">given an input sequence ($U$) of (at least partially) un-sorted elements $U=u_{1},u_{2}, ..., u_{n}$, output a new sequence $S = s_{1}, s_{2}, ... , s_{n}$ which is a permutation of the elements in $U$ such that $s_{1}\\leq s_{2}, ..., \\leq s_{n}$.\n",

    "## Selection sort\n",
    "\n",
    "Selection sort is the simplest of the sorting algorithms.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of **selection sort** is that given $U=u_{1},u_{2},...,u_{n}$ the algorithm loops through all the elements of $U$, finds the minimum $u_m$ and places it at the beginning of the sequence $U$, swapping $u_{1}$ with $u_m$. At the next iteration, the algorithm continues looking for the minimum starting from $u_2$ and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $U$ has $n$ elements, we need to perform the following two steps for each position $i=0,..,n-1$ in the list:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (argmin) Find index of the minimum element in the sublist $U[i:]$, let's call it $min$ (i.e. $u_{min} = min(U[i:])$);\n",
    "\n",
    "2. (swap) Swap $u_{min}$ with $u_i$;\n",
    "\n",
    "A reminder on how selection sort works is shown in this picture taken from the lecture slides. Yellow cells are the minimum found at each iteration, while orange cells are those already sorted by previous iterations.\n",

This method builds the return list by getting the minimum element of the two lists, \"removing\" it from the corresponding list and appending it to the list with the result. \"removal\" can be done by using two indexes pointing to the smallest elements of each of the two (sub)lists and incrementing the index of the minimum of the two (i.e. the element that is also copied to the result list);\n",
    "\n",
    "2. (```recursiveMergeSort```): gets an unordered (sub)list, the index of the beginning of the list, and the index of the end of the list.

    "\n",
    "The idea is that, given an unsorted list $U = u_1, ..., u_n$, at each step a **pivot** $j$ is selected and elements are rearranged in a way that all $u_i$ such that $u_i < u_j$ are placed at the left of $u_j$ and all $u_h$ such that $u_h$ > $u_j$ are placed to the right of $u_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This *divide and conquer* approach works like that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (*divide*) partition the initial list $U = u_1, .., u_n$ in two non-empty sublists (reordering the elements) such that all the elements in the first sublist are lower than the elements in the second. The pivot element $u_j$ is such that all the elements $u_i$ for $1 \\leq i \\lt j$ are lower than $u_j$ and all $u_k$ for $k > j$ are higher than $u_j$;\n",
    "2. (*conquer*) each sublist is recurisvely partitioned in two sublists, repeating until single elements are reached;\n",
    "3. (*recombine*) nothing is left to do to recombine the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "A graphical representation of the algorithm follows (red elements are the pivot of each sublist):\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/quicksort.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm makes use of the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ```pivot```: gets the list, a ```start``` and ```end``` index, sets the first element as **pivot** and reorders all the elements in the list from ```start``` to ```end``` in such a way that all the elements to the left of the pivot (i.e. having index lower) are smaller than the pivot and all the elements to the right (i.e. with index higher) are bigger than the pivot. The function returns the index of the pivot;\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ```swap```: gets two indexes and swaps their values;\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ```recursiveQuickSort```: gets an unordered (sub)list, with ```start``` and ```end``` positions and finds the pivot and recursively applies the same procedure to the sublists to the left and right of the pivot;\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ```quickSort```: gets an unordered list and applies the recursive quick sort procedure to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pivot method is shown below (from lecture slides). The pivot is initially set to the first element of the sublist, then all the elements in the interval ```start``` - ```end``` are compared to it (using an index $i$) and placed right after the pivot if smaller (updating an index $j$ on where the pivot should go at the end of the procedure), left untouched otherwise. At the end the pivot is moved to position $j$. The pivot is yellow and moved elements are pink:\n",

    "\n",
    "![](images/quick_sort1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The average case complexity of the quick sort algorithm is $O(n log n)$ with $n$ being the number of elements in the list. The worst case complexity is $O(n^2)$ which is worse than merge sort's $O(n log n)$. In general, however, it performs better than merge sort."
